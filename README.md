# Huffman Algorithm

HuffmanCompressor generates the frequencies of each character in a given file.
HuffmanCode creates the Huffman code from the frequencies.
HuffmanCode writes out the Huffman codes to a .code file.
HuffmanCompressor writes a .short file.

Decompression Algorithm
HuffmanCode reads in a .code file in standard format.
HuffmanCode writes out a .new file. after decompressing the code

to run, ```javac HuffmanCompressor.java``` and then ```java HuffmanCompressor```
